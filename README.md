# fibonacci

In this challenge exercise, you will write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence. 
You should implement the code two ways: with and without recursion and use benchmarking tools to see which implementation 
is more efficient. 
The mathematical definition of Fibonacci numbers is below:

fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
Basically what that means is that the sequence starts off with a 0 and a 1, and then each corresponding digit is the sum 
of the two previous digits.
